Neural Network (CNN)
•Developed a Convolutional Neural Network based flower classification model using TensorFlow, achieving an
accuracy of 85.46%.
•Implemented dropout regularization with a rate of 0.2 to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping 20% of neurons
during training.
•Created a user-friendly interface using Gradio to allow users to interactively classify flower images using the trained
model. Users can upload images or use their webcam for real-time classification.
